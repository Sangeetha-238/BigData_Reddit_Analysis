This page outlines a technical proposal designed to address specific business goals by applying NLP methodologies to analyze and understand the content of subreddits. The primary objectives include uncovering popular themes and gauging sentiment.The subreddit chosen for analysis in this part is r/anime, r/movies, r/Animesuggest, r/MovieSuggestions.

### Technical Analysis Report

#### Comprehensive Analysis Report on Reddit Discussions: Unveiling Trends in Movie Popularity

This analysis aims to discern prevailing trends in Reddit discussions related to movies. The primary goal is to compile a dataset featuring the most talked-about movies on the platform. Subsequently, this dataset will be cross-referenced with our external review data, particularly from platforms like Rotten Tomatoes. The objective is to determine if movies generating the most buzz on Reddit also receive positive critical acclaim or exhibit differing evaluations.

Before delving into detailed text cleaning processes, we conducted a preliminary analysis encompassing both movie and anime-related Reddit communities. Our overarching goal is to ultimately provide insights on Movies, Anime, and TV shows. In this initial phase, we performed a word count analysis on submissions from both movie and anime Reddits. Below are the top words identified, accompanied by their respective counts:

This initial exploration has revealed that discussions on Reddit heavily revolve around users' favorite anime and movies. To gain deeper insights, our next step involves analyzing the comments more comprehensively to extract the specific names of the most-discussed movies and anime. By doing so, we aim to identify the titles that resonate most strongly within the community, shedding light on the exceptionally popular content among Reddit users.

In our analysis of Reddit comments related to movies, we initially employed TF-IDF vectorization on a DataFrame containing cleaned and tokenized text. While TF-IDF is a powerful technique for understanding the significance of words within individual documents relative to the entire dataset, its application in our specific context has revealed limitations.

TF-IDF is inherently designed to highlight the importance of words in a document set, but its utility in extracting specific movie and anime references from Reddit comments appears to be constrained. Our objective is to identify and extract the most discussed or mentioned movie and anime titles, and for this purpose, alternative methods may prove more effective.

Recognizing the unique nature of our analysis, we have decided to explore alternative approaches that directly cater to the extraction of movie and anime references from Reddit comments. This strategic shift is grounded in the understanding that while TF-IDF is valuable for certain tasks, it may not be the optimal choice for our current goal of pinpointing and analyzing explicit references to movies and anime in the Reddit data.

By adopting alternative methods tailored to our specific objective, we aim to enhance the precision and relevance of our analysis, ensuring a more effective exploration of the most discussed titles within the Reddit community. This adaptive approach aligns our methodology with the intricacies of the content present in Reddit comments, optimizing our ability to uncover and analyze meaningful movie and anime references.


Key Steps:

- Extracting movie names from the reddit comment Submission

- To extract relevant information efficiently, we employed sophisticated text cleaning techniques. These included:

- **Document Assembler:** Aggregated and organized the raw text data from Reddit comments, preparing it for further processing.

- **Sentence Detector:** Segregated the text into distinct sentences, enhancing the granularity of our analysis.

- **BERT Embeddings:** Utilized advanced BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) embeddings to capture contextualized representations of words, improving the accuracy of subsequent analyses.

- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Applied NER techniques to identify entities within the text, specifically focusing on recognizing movie names mentioned in the comments. Using ORG and PERSON labels

- **NER Converter:** Transformed the identified named entities, such as movie names, into a structured format suitable for dataset construction.

After extracting initial movie names, we employed targeted regex pattern matching to capture additional titles:

- **Camel Casing Words:** Identified and extracted movie titles written in Camel Case format.
- **Quoted Phrases:** Recognized and extracted movie names enclosed within double quotes.
- **Capitalized Word Pairs:** Extracted words between two capital-letter-starting words, facilitating retrieval of stylistically formatted movie titles.
- **Numeric Associations:** Captured numeric values following movie mentions, linking numerical information like release years to specific titles.
- **Year in Parentheses:** Identified words before the year mentioned within parentheses, aiding in the extraction of titles near their release years.

Following this extraction, we refined the dataset by removing stop words based on element length. This meticulous process enhanced the accuracy and relevance of our dataset, ensuring a nuanced and precise analysis of movie discussions on Reddit.

In the subsequent phase, our focus shifted to conducting sentiment analysis on our external dataset, utilizing the Rotten Tomatoes movie review dataset. To ensure the data was well-prepared for sentiment analysis, we implemented a series of fundamental text cleaning processes. The key techniques applied included:

- **Document Assembler:** Aggregated and organized the raw text data, preparing it for subsequent processing steps.
- **Tokenizer:** Employed tokenization to break down the text into individual units, enhancing the granularity of our analysis.
- **Normalizer:** Applied normalization techniques to standardize the text, ensuring consistent formatting and reducing variability.
- **Lemmatizer:** Utilized lemmatization to transform words to their base or root form, enhancing the accuracy of sentiment analysis by considering the underlying meaning of words.
- **Stopwords Remover:** Implemented a stopwords removal process to eliminate common words that do not contribute significantly to sentiment analysis, thereby focusing on more meaningful content.

These text cleaning techniques collectively facilitated the creation of a refined and standardized dataset for sentiment analysis.

For sentiment analysis, we employed two distinct sentiment models:

- **SentimentDL_use_twitter:** This model leverages advanced deep learning techniques to discern sentiment, particularly tailored for the nuances and expressions commonly found in Twitter-like text.
- **ClassifierDL_use_emotion:** Utilizing a classifier approach, this model gauges sentiment by understanding emotional nuances present in the text, providing a comprehensive analysis of sentiment with a focus on emotional context.

By incorporating these advanced sentiment analysis models and employing meticulous text cleaning processes, we aimed to extract nuanced sentiment insights from the Rotten Tomatoes movie review dataset. This multi-faceted approach ensures a robust and comprehensive analysis of sentiment dynamics associated with the movies in our external dataset.
