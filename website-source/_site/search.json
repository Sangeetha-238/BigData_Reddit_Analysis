    "text": "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) plays a pivotal role in our project focused on unraveling the dynamics of the Entertainment subreddit within the vast landscape of Reddit. Think of this page as a magnifying glass, focusing on the intricacies of the colossal dataset. Each entry is a chapter in the evolving story, carefully organized for exploration, much like preparing a canvas before an artist begins to paint.\nJoin us on this analytical odyssey where every data point is a clue, and every visualization is a window into the nuanced landscape of the Entertainment subreddit. The EDA page is where we decode the language of data, bringing you closer to the stories that lie beneath the surface of this dynamic digital community. Welcome to the realm of Exploratory Data Analysis, where understanding the data is the key to unlocking the richness of our Reddit exploration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of missing values in the data\nThis table represents a summary of missing values in a dataset extracted from Reddit. Each row corresponds to a different feature in the dataset, and the ‘Missing Values’ column quantifies the absence of data entries for each feature.\nColumns such as ‘author’, ‘title’, ‘selftext’, ‘created_utc’, ‘num_comments’, ‘score’, ‘over_18’, ‘pinned’, and ‘locked’ show complete data with zero missing values, suggesting they are mandatory fields within the platform’s post submission process.\nIn contrast, a significant number of missing values are observed in the ‘disable_comments’, ‘distinguished’, and ‘media’ columns. This could indicate that these fields are not always applicable or are frequently left blank. For instance, ‘distinguished’ could denote a special status assigned to certain posts, which would naturally be less common. Similarly, ‘media’ might be optional or applicable only for certain types of posts.\nThis table is important for understanding the dataset’s structure and quality, and it underlines the need for thorough data cleaning and validation steps before any reliable analysis can be performed.\n\n \n\n  \n  Table-1: Count of missing values of all the columns for submissions dataset\n\n\n\n\nAnalysing the extracted submissions in subreddits\nThis bar chart provides a comparative analysis of post counts across various entertainment-related subreddits. The ‘anime’ subreddit has the highest number of posts, with over 400,000 entries, indicative of a very active community with a strong interest in anime-related content. This is followed by the ‘movies’ subreddit, which also boasts a high level of activity with more than 380,000 posts. Both ‘anime’ and ‘movies’ subreddits significantly outpace the ‘television’ subreddit in terms of post counts, suggesting a comparatively higher user engagement in the former topics.\nLooking at subreddits dedicated to suggestions within these categories (AnimeSuggestions, MovieSuggestions, and televisionsuggestions), there is a clear indication that there is a substantial interest in community-driven recommendations for anime, as the ‘AnimeSuggestions’ subreddit has a higher post count than both ‘MovieSuggestions’ and ‘televisionsuggestions’. The ‘MovieSuggestions’ subreddit has a moderate number of posts, while ‘televisionsuggestions’ has the least, reflecting lower user engagement for television recommendations on this platform.\nThese differences in post counts may reflect varying degrees of popularity, user engagement, and possibly the availability of content in each entertainment medium. The data suggests that within this online community, users are more likely to seek and share recommendations for anime and movies rather than television shows.\n\n\n\nFigure-1: Count of each subreddit in the dataset from 2021-2023\n\n\n\n\nTime-series Analysis\n\nWhat is the general trend of posts from 2021-2023?\nThe time-related plots depicting the distribution of posts across the subreddits ‘anime’, ‘movies’, and ‘television’ from 2021 to 2023 reveal a discernible downward trajectory in user engagement and post counts. While the ‘anime’ subreddit shows a pronounced peak, indicative of a temporary surge in activity, it is followed by a significant decline. This pattern suggests that sustaining high engagement levels over time may be challenging, even when punctuated by periods of heightened activity.\nIn parallel, the ‘movies’ and ‘television’ subreddits exhibit a more gradual decline, implying a slow yet consistent decrease in the number of posts and interactions. This could point to a broader trend of diminishing user participation or could reflect a diversification of discussions across newer platforms or different online communities.\nThe overarching decline across all three subreddits raises questions about the factors influencing these changes. The possibility of shifting platform dynamics, evolving content consumption patterns, or the rise of alternative entertainment forums could be contributing to this trend. It indicates a potential shift in the digital landscape where traditional subreddit forums may no longer command the same level of attention as before.\nThis insight suggests an opportunity for subreddit administrators and content creators to re-evaluate their engagement strategies. Exploring innovative content delivery, leveraging interactive media, or tapping into emerging trends could potentially reverse the decline in post counts. As digital platforms continue to evolve, so must the strategies to captivate and maintain active user communities.\n \n\n  \n  Figure-2: This graph illustrates the normalized post count trends across three subreddits (anime, movies, and television) over a span of two years, from January 2021 to April 2023. The peaks and troughs indicate fluctuations in user engagement and post frequency within these online communities.\n\n\n\n\nHow are scores affected by posting on different days of the month?\nThe line chart titled “Average Score by Day of Month Across Subreddits” offers a detailed visual of how user engagement varies throughout the month within the subreddits of ‘movies’, ‘anime’, and ‘television’. The ‘movies’ subreddit demonstrates the highest variance in average scores, suggesting that certain days of the month may align with the release of popular content, leading to spikes in user interaction and high-scoring posts. In contrast, ‘anime’ and ‘television’ subreddits exhibit a more consistent pattern of engagement, with less pronounced peaks and troughs.\nThe trend across all three subreddits does not show a clear cyclical pattern that could be associated with specific days of the month, indicating that post scores are more likely influenced by content availability and user interest rather than the time of the month. The relative stability in ‘anime’ and ‘television’ subreddits could imply a steady production of content that resonates with the audience, leading to a more uniform level of engagement.\nThis insight into user behavior could be harnessed by content creators and marketers to strategically time their posts to coincide with peak engagement periods identified within the ‘movies’ subreddit. Moreover, the consistent engagement in the ‘anime’ and ‘television’ subreddits suggests a reliable and dedicated audience base, which could be attractive to advertisers and collaborators looking for stable platforms to promote their products or services. Overall, understanding these engagement patterns is crucial for optimizing content delivery and maintaining a vibrant and interactive online community.\n \n\n  \n  Figure-3:Average score of posts submitted on different days of the month from 2021-2023\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis of the number of posts during the week\nThe sunburst chart provides a vivid depiction of the distribution of posts across days of the week and hours of the day for the subreddits ‘anime’, ‘movies’, and ‘television’. It reveals the time-specific activity patterns within these communities. For the ‘anime’ subreddit, there’s a notable concentration of activity during certain hours, which may correspond to peak times when users are most active or when new content is typically released. The ‘movies’ subreddit shows a more spread out activity throughout the week, suggesting a consistent level of engagement without significant peaks or troughs.\nThis visual suggests that the ‘television’ subreddit has its own unique pattern of user interaction, potentially reflecting the airing schedule of popular shows or weekly events that drive discussions. Understanding these patterns can help content creators and moderators to optimize their engagement strategies by scheduling posts and discussions during high-activity windows to maximize visibility and interaction.\nOverall, these insights highlight the importance of timing in online community engagement. For marketers and content creators, aligning content releases with these observed peaks could enhance user engagement. For platform moderators, it could inform the scheduling of events or AMAs (Ask Me Anything sessions) to ensure higher participation rates. Additionally, this data could assist in the strategic placement of advertisements, ensuring they reach the most active audience segments.\n \n\n  \n  Figure-4: Number of posts during the week for the subreddits\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Engagement Analysis\n\nComparative Analysis of Post Engagement by Length and Score in Entertainment-Related Subreddits\nThis scatter plot illustrates the engagement dynamics of Reddit posts, comparing post length to user engagement across subreddits dedicated to anime, movies, and television. Each dot represents an individual post, with its size corresponding to the score, which is a proxy for the post’s popularity or engagement level.\nA cursory analysis reveals a dense clustering of posts with scores under 10,000 across all subreddits, with post lengths predominantly falling below 2000 characters. This suggests that shorter posts are more common, regardless of the subreddit category. Interestingly, there is a visible trend where posts with higher scores tend to have shorter lengths, indicating that more concise posts may resonate better with the audience or are more likely to be engaged with.\nThe larger-sized dots, indicating posts with exceptionally high scores, are predominantly short and are scattered across all three subreddits. This may indicate that highly engaging posts, which are likely to go viral or hit the front page of Reddit, tend to be succinct.\nThis insight can inform content creators and marketers about optimal post lengths for audience engagement in different entertainment categories on Reddit.\n \n\n  \n  Figure-5: Correlation between post lengths and scores within anime, movies, and television subreddits on Reddit.\n\n\n\n\nTop Reddit Authors by Comment Engagement in the subreddit Discussion\nThe table presents a ranking of authors by the comment volume on their posts in the movie, television and anime subreddits. High comment counts generally indicate that an author’s contributions are well-received, sparking active discussions among the subreddit’s users. This level of engagement typically reflects the community’s interest and the value they find in the content shared by the author.\nThe table not only identifies the most engaging authors in the subreddits but also underscores the importance of creating content that encourages community participation. The data provides valuable insights into user engagement and could be leveraged to understand better what types of posts cultivate active discussions in online communities.\n\n \n\n  \n  Table-2: Ranks of authors from a subreddit based on the number of comments their posts receive, highlighting the most engaging content creators\n\n\n\n\nLeading Content Creators based on top Comments\nThe bar chart presents the post counts attributed to the ten most active authors within the subreddits “movies, anime, and television”. These counts are a direct indicator of the quantity of content contributed by individual authors rather than the quality or engagement level of the posts.\nThe presence of active contributors can be vital for fostering community engagement and providing a steady stream of content for discussion. On the other hand, the steep drop in post counts after the third author indicates that there is less parity in content contribution among the top authors. The remaining seven authors in the list show a relatively lower level of activity, with post counts ranging from moderate to minimal. This disparity suggests that a small group of authors may dominate the conversation or content within this subreddit.\nThe movies subreddit appears to have a few highly active authors who contribute a significant portion of the content. This concentration of activity might influence the diversity of topics and perspectives presented within the community.\nIn the television subreddit, the distribution of post counts among the top ten authors reveals a significant skew, with ‘MarvelsGrantMan136’ and ‘Neo2199’ being the most active. This pattern suggests that the television subreddit may rely on a small group of dedicated individuals for a substantial portion of its content, which could potentially influence the scope and variety of discussions within the community.\nContrastingly, the anime subreddit presents a unique scenario where bots, rather than human authors, are the primary content contributors. Interestingly, despite—or perhaps because of—the automated nature of their posts, these bot-generated discussions are engaging the community to a greater extent than typical human-authored posts on the platform. This could be attributed to the bots providing timely, consistently formatted, and relevant content that resonates well with the subreddit’s audience.\nThe high engagement with bot posts in the anime subreddit may also reflect the community’s preference for structured information, such as regular updates on anime releases, episode discussions, and well-organized recommendation lists. These automated posts may fulfill the community’s needs more effectively than the more varied human contributions found in other subreddits.\nIn light of this, the anime subreddit stands out as a unique case study in community engagement on social platforms, showcasing that automated systems, when well-tuned to the audience’s preferences, can play a pivotal role in fostering active online communities. This insight challenges the conventional wisdom that the most engaging content must be human-generated and highlights the potential for bots to contribute meaningfully to online discourse in interest-specific forums.\n \n\n  \n  Figure-6: This bar chart ranks the top 10 authors in the subreddit based on the number of posts they have made and the top comments received\n\n\n\n\nTop Reddit Posts Authors by Scores Engagement in the subreddit Discussion\nThe table shows a list from a subreddit, ranking the top 10 posts by score. For the movie subreddit, the highest-scoring post is an AMA with Tobey Maguire, indicating that interactive sessions with famous actors are highly valued in the community. This is further emphasized by the presence of another AMA with Keanu Reeves in the second position. The third highest post by Nicolas Cage suggests that personal engagement from actors or filmmakers garners significant attention.\nPosts regarding industry news and opinions, such as the win of Brendan Fraser at the Academy Awards and a call to prioritize voice actors over celebrities in animated features, reflect the community’s interest in both celebrating achievements and critiquing industry trends. A post about a ‘Dune’ sequel hints at the community’s enthusiasm for science fiction and blockbuster franchises.\nNotably, there is a discussion on diversity in casting, pointing towards a conscious reflection on representation in movies. The list also shows a mix of content authors, from individual users to likely official accounts like “lionsgate,” indicating a blend of community-driven content and industry participation in the subreddit.\nFor the television subreddit, The most popular post highlights a public figure, LeVar Burton, expressing his desire to become the new host of “Jeopardy!”, which is indicative of the community’s interest in show hostings and personalities associated with them. This is further emphasized by another post where Burton encourages the producers of “Jeopardy!” to consider him for the role, showcasing the community’s support for his candidacy.\nOther posts indicate strong community interest in television show news and updates, like the revival of “Futurama” and a potential third season for “Mindhunter.” The active engagement in these topics suggests that news about television series renewals and continuations is particularly resonant with the audience.\nThese posts reflect a community that is deeply engaged with the television industry, from show developments and castings to the achievements and remembrances of beloved television figures. The scores provide insight into what type of content the community values and discusses most, which includes industry news, show developments, and the accomplishments and milestones of individuals in television.\nMoving to the anime, The top post is about the death of Kentaro Miura, the creator of “Berserk,” which underscores the impact that influential figures in the anime industry have on the community. The high score indicates that news about significant personalities, especially those who have made a profound impact on the genre, resonates deeply with the audience.\nSeveral posts relate to announcements of new seasons for popular anime series like “The Devil is a Part-Timer,” “Spice and Wolf,” and “Konosuba.” This suggests that the subreddit is a hub for fans to discuss and share their excitement about continuing series and new developments within their favorite anime.\nThere is also a post about a prediction tournament for “Best Girl,” a common discussion topic in anime communities where fans vote for their favorite female characters. The popularity of such a post indicates that interactive and participatory events are engaging for the community members.\n\n \n\n  \n  Table-3: Ranks of authors from a subreddit based on the Scores their posts receive, highlighting the most engaging content creators\n\n\n\n\nLeading Content Creators based on top Scores\nThe bar chart depicts the top 10 authors by post count within the anime, movies, and television subreddits, with a specific focus on those receiving the highest scores, which could be indicative of the popularity of the posts.\n‘AutoLovepon’ leads in the anime subreddit with an exceptionally high post count, indicating a significant impact on the community, likely due to consistent, high-quality content, which could be automated. In the movies subreddit, ‘MarvelsGrantMan136’ dominates but is followed by a group of authors with notable contributions, reflecting a community with diverse yet influential voices. The television subreddit shows ‘MarvelsGrantMan136’ leading, with a narrower margin over ‘chanma50’, suggesting a broader spread of engagement across various authors. These patterns highlight different engagement dynamics, with a single dominant presence in anime and a more varied influence among authors in the movies and television subreddits, offering insights into community preferences and influencer identification.\n \n\n  \n  Figure-7: This bar chart ranks the top 10 authors in the subreddit based on the number of posts they have made and the top scores received\n\n\n\n\nAuthors with the highest number of posts\nThe bar chart provides an overview of the top 10 active authors in the anime, movies, and television subreddits, showing a clear disparity in activity levels across these categories.\nFor the movies subreddit, the top author has an exceptionally high post count, exceeding 20,000, which is significantly higher than the subsequent authors. This could imply a central role in the subreddit, possibly as a source of extensive information or regular discussion threads. However, the drop in post counts among the following authors is stark, indicating a less concentrated field of active contributors and suggesting a more varied source of content within the community.\nIn the television subreddit, the post counts among the top authors are more evenly distributed, with ‘MarvelsGrantMan136’ leading but with a smaller margin compared to the leaders in the anime and movies subreddits. This indicates a more balanced contribution from the top authors, which could result in a diverse range of discussions and viewpoints being represented in the subreddit.\nMoving to the anime subreddit, the leading author, presumably a bot named ‘AutoLovepon’, has a post count that far exceeds that of any human contributor, with over 6000 posts. This suggests a high level of automation in content generation, which is indicative of a structured and consistent posting strategy, possibly catering to the demand for updates, recommendations, or scheduled discussion threads. Given the nature of bot-generated content, this level of activity might provide a streamlined experience for users seeking information without the variability of human-authored posts.\nIn conclusion, these engagement models reflect the unique cultural dynamics of each subreddit, providing valuable insights for content creators, moderators, and marketers on how to approach each community effectively.\n \n\n  \n  Figure-8: This bar chart ranks the top 10 authors in the subreddit based on the number of posts they have made\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion for Engagement Analysis:\nThe comparative analysis of the post counts from the top authors across the anime, movies, and television subreddits reveals distinct patterns of community engagement and content contribution. In the anime subreddit, the dominance of the bot ‘AutoLovepon’ highlights a preference for structured, automated content, which contrasts sharply with the human-driven contributions in the movies and television subreddits.

    "text": "This page outlines a technical proposal designed to address specific business goals by applying NLP methodologies to analyze and understand the content of subreddits. The primary objectives include uncovering popular themes and gauging sentiment. The subreddit chosen for analysis in this part is r/anime, r/movies, r/Animesuggest, r/MovieSuggestions.\n\nTechnical Analysis Report\n\nComprehensive Analysis Report on Reddit Discussions: Unveiling Trends in Movie Popularity\nThis analysis aims to discern prevailing trends in Reddit discussions related to movies. The primary goal is to compile a dataset featuring the most talked-about movies on the platform. Subsequently, this dataset will be cross-referenced with our external review data, particularly from platforms like Rotten Tomatoes. The objective is to determine if movies generating the most buzz on Reddit also receive positive critical acclaim or exhibit differing evaluations.\nBefore delving into detailed text cleaning processes, we conducted a preliminary analysis encompassing both movie and anime-related Reddit communities. Our overarching goal is to ultimately provide insights on Movies, Anime, and TV shows. In this initial phase, we performed a word count analysis on submissions from both movie and anime Reddits. Below are the top words identified, accompanied by their respective counts:\n\n\n \n\n  \n  Table-1: Count of words for movies\n\n\n \n\n  \n  Table-2: Count of words for anime\n\n\nThis initial exploration has revealed that discussions on Reddit heavily revolve around users’ favorite anime and movies. To gain deeper insights, our next step involves analyzing the comments more comprehensively to extract the specific names of the most-discussed movies and anime. By doing so, we aim to identify the titles that resonate most strongly within the community, shedding light on the exceptionally popular content among Reddit users.\nIn our analysis of Reddit comments related to movies, we initially employed TF-IDF vectorization on a DataFrame containing cleaned and tokenized text. While TF-IDF is a powerful technique for understanding the significance of words within individual documents relative to the entire dataset, its application in our specific context has revealed limitations.\nTF-IDF is inherently designed to highlight the importance of words in a document set, but its utility in extracting specific movie and anime references from Reddit comments appears to be constrained. Our objective is to identify and extract the most discussed or mentioned movie and anime titles, and for this purpose, alternative methods may prove more effective.\nRecognizing the unique nature of our analysis, we have decided to explore alternative approaches that directly cater to the extraction of movie and anime references from Reddit comments. This strategic shift is grounded in the understanding that while TF-IDF is valuable for certain tasks, it may not be the optimal choice for our current goal of pinpointing and analyzing explicit references to movies and anime in the Reddit data.\nBy adopting alternative methods tailored to our specific objective, we aim to enhance the precision and relevance of our analysis, ensuring a more effective exploration of the most discussed titles within the Reddit community. This adaptive approach aligns our methodology with the intricacies of the content present in Reddit comments, optimizing our ability to uncover and analyze meaningful movie and anime references.\n\n\nMost Suggested Movies on Reddit\nThe social platform Reddit is a treasure trove of public opinion and preferences, particularly when it comes to movie recommendations. To extract the movies, we’ve implemented a data extraction and analysis pipeline to identify the most frequently suggested movies across various Reddit threads.\n\n\n\nFigure-1: Workflow Pipeline for Extracting Movie and Anime Suggestions from Reddit data\n\n\n\nMethodology:\n\nNamed Entity Recognition (NER): NER was applied to extract movie titles from unstructured text in Reddit discussions.\nPattern Matching: Further refinement was achieved through pattern matching techniques to ensure accurate identification of movie titles.\nContext Analysis: The context surrounding extracted entities was analyzed to validate the relevance of identified movie titles.\nExplode and Aggregate: The data was transformed through the “explode” operation, breaking down entries into individual suggestions. Aggregation techniques were then employed to count the occurrences of each movie title, providing a quantitative measure. We initiated the process by collecting Reddit posts from threads likely to contain movie suggestions. This involved utilizing Reddit’s API to fetch posts from subreddits renowned for movie discussions. Upon retrieval, the posts underwent a standard preprocessing stage, which included lowercasing, tokenization, and the removal of stop words and punctuation. This step was crucial to prepare the text data for more sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) tasks.\n\nNamed Entity Recognition (NER) The cleansed text data was then processed through a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model. NER is an NLP technique that automatically identifies and classifies key information in text, such as the names of people, places, and, pertinent to our task, movies. We utilized a pre-trained NER model tailored to recognize movie titles within a larger corpus.\nText Processing Workflow Document Structuring\n\nDocument Assembler: The initial step involves converting each comment text into a structured document format. This process, facilitated by a Document Assembler, lays the foundation for a systematic and organized analysis.\nSentence Segmentation:Sentence Detector: Following document structuring, the content is segmented into sentences using a Sentence Detector. This step is crucial for breaking down the textual information into manageable units, preparing it for more granular analysis.\nTokenization: Tokenizer: Sentences are further deconstructed into individual tokens using a Tokenizer. This process is integral to understanding the intricacies of the text at a word level, facilitating a nuanced examination of user comments.\nWord Embeddings: Word Embeddings Model (glove_100d): To transform tokens into numerical vector representations, we employ a Word Embeddings Model, specifically glove_100d. This model captures semantic relationships between words, enabling a more profound analysis of the comment text.\nNamed Entity Recognition (NER): NERDL Model (ner_dl): The identified vectors undergo Named Entity Recognition using an advanced NERDL model. This step involves classifying entities within the vectors, distinguishing elements such as persons, organizations, and locations, contributing to a richer understanding of the comment content.\nEntity Chunking: Identified entities are then intelligently grouped into coherent chunks using a NER Converter. This chunking process enhances the organization and structure of the information, revealing patterns and relationships within the identified entities.\nSuggestion Extraction: User Defined Function (UDF): Focusing on entities classified as “PERSON” and “ORG,” a User Defined Function (UDF) is applied to extract suggestions from the identified chunks. This step allows for the extraction of meaningful insights related to individuals and organizations mentioned in the comments.\n\nPattern Matching In parallel to NER, we employed pattern matching algorithms to capture movie mentions that might not be recognized by NER. Pattern matching utilized a combination of keyword searches and lexical patterns that are commonly associated with movie titles.\n\nCommon Pattern Identification: Utilizing a Regex pattern (pattern = r’(?:“([^\"]+)”|([A-Z][a-z](?:+(?:[a-z]++)[A-Z][a-z]))(?: )?)’), we embark on identifying common patterns within the dataset. This pattern is designed to capture both quoted phrases and properly formatted movie titles with their release years.\nData Refinement using User Defined Functions (UDFs):Stopwords and Single-Letter,Movies Removal Stopwords Exclusion UDF: Applying a User Defined Function (UDF), we meticulously remove movies that consist solely of stopwords. This ensures that the dataset is refined to exclude movies with minimal informational content. Single-Letter Movies Exclusion UDF: Another UDF is employed to eliminate movies with only a single letter in their titles. This step is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the dataset by filtering out entries that may not contribute substantial information or context.\n\nContext Analysis To refine the results further, context analysis was performed. This method assessed the surrounding text of potential movie titles to discern whether the mention was indeed a suggestion. For example, phrases like “I recommend” or “you should watch” preceding a movie title indicated a suggestion.\nData Transformation The identified movie titles were transformed into a structured format suitable for analysis. The transformation involved “exploding” lists of movies found in individual posts into separate records to facilitate counting.\nAggregation Finally, we aggregated the results by counting the frequency of each unique movie title across the dataset. This step was implemented using group-by operations that tallied the number of suggestions per movie. The aggregation stage culminated in a ranked list of movies by the number of times they were suggested. This ranked list provided clear insights into the most popular movie recommendations on Reddit.\n\n\n\nFigure-2: lollipop plot showing the the top 10 suggested movies on reddit\n\n\nUpon analyzing user recommendations on Reddit, “Hereditary” stood out as the most frequently suggested movie. This observation prompted us to delve deeper into whether these highly recommended films were not only popular among users but also well-received in terms of positive sentiment.\nTo assess this, we turned to the extensive review data available on Rotten Tomatoes. Our goal was to determine if the movies recommended on Reddit also lay up high ratings and positive sentiments from critics and audiences alike. To achieve this, we conducted sentiment analysis on the review data, calculating sentiment scores for each film.\nThe sentiment analysis allowed us to quantify the balance between positive and negative sentiments expressed in the reviews. Subsequently, we devised a comprehensive rating metric that considered both the sentiment scores and overall sentiment polarity. This approach aimed to provide a nuanced understanding of how well-received the movies were, beyond conventional rating systems. By correlating the recommendations from Reddit with sentiment scores and ratings on Rotten Tomatoes, our analysis sought to reveal whether the most suggested movies on the platform not only captured the attention of users but also resonated positively with a broader audience, shedding light on the intersection of user preferences and critical acclaim.\n\n\n\nSENTIMENT ANALYSIS ON ROTTEN TOMATOES REVIEW DATA\nOur journey into sentiment analysis commenced with the comprehensive collection of review text for every movie listed on Rotten Tomatoes. This comprehensive dataset was the foundation for our analysis, containing a wide range of opinions from both expert critics and a variety of moviegoers.\n\n\n\nFigure-3: Workflow Pipeline for Sentiment Analysis on movie and anime reviews.\n\n\nData Cleaning Process\nDocument Conversion: To impart structure to the amassed review text, we employed a sophisticated Document Assembler. This transformative step converted the initially unstructured reviews into a meticulously organized format, laying a robust foundation for the subsequent analytical stages.\nTokenization: Embracing the power of a Tokenizer, we meticulously dissected the reviews into individual tokens. This intricate segmentation allowed us to discern the nuanced intricacies within each review, enabling us to capture the essence of expressed opinions at a remarkably granular level.\nNormalization: In pursuit of data uniformity, we judiciously normalized all tokens to lowercase using a specialized Normalizer. This meticulous adjustment eradicated potential inconsistencies stemming from variations in letter case, fostering a standardized dataset primed for in-depth analysis.\nLemmatization: Elevating the sophistication of our understanding, a Lemmatizer Model was applied to refine the reviews further. This process intelligently reduced words to their base root form, amplifying the model’s capability to grasp the fundamental meaning and sentiment intricately woven into each review.\nData Transformation: The meticulously processed data underwent a transformative phase, transitioning into a human-readable format facilitated by a Finisher. This critical step enhanced the interpretability of the dataset, setting the stage for subsequent insightful analyses.\nSentiment Analysis:\nDocument Structuring: The pre-processed data was once again converted into a structured document format, preparing it for the advanced stages of sentiment analysis.\nSentence Embeddings: Using the capabilities of the tfhub_use model, we converted the documents into numerical sentence embeddings. This step facilitated a deeper understanding of the semantic content within each review, capturing the intricacies of expressed opinions.\nSentiment Inference: Leveraging the power of the Sentiment DL Model (specifically, sentimentdl_use_twitter), we determined the sentiment of each review. Trained on diverse data, this model enabled precise inference, categorizing sentiments as positive or negative.\nTo refine the sentiment-based rating system, we’ve established a more nuanced metric known as the Weighted Rating (WR). This formula adjusts the movie rating by considering both the volume and the sentiment of the reviews. Here’s how the Weighted Rating is calculated:\n\\[\nWeighted Rating (WR) = \\frac{v}{v + m} \\times R + \\frac{m}{v + m} \\times C\n\\]\nWhere:\n\nWR is the Weighted Rating.\nR is the average sentiment rating of the movie.\nv is the number of reviews for the movie.\nm is the minimum number of reviews required for the movie to be considered in the rating system.\nCis the mean sentiment score across all movies included in the report.\n\nFor this calculation, we differentiate between positive and negative sentiment scores. These scores reflect the average sentiment of all reviews that were classified as positive or negative, respectively. This distinction allows for a more detailed sentiment analysis in our rating system.\nThe mean score of positive sentiment, if ‘C_positive’, is approximately 0.7526, suggesting that on average, movies receive favorable reviews. Conversely, the mean score of negative sentiment, C_negative, is approximately 0.2474, indicating a smaller proportion of reviews are negative.\nThe median number of reviews required, m , is set to 4 but can be adjusted to fit different criteria or data sets.\nIn the data processing phase, we add two new columns to our data frame:\n1.positive_weighted_rating_df: This column applies the Weighted Rating formula using the average positive sentiment score for each movie, coupled with the mean positive sentiment score across the dataset.\n2.negative_weighted_rating_df: Similarly, this column uses the average negative sentiment score for each movie, integrated with the mean negative sentiment score across the dataset.\nBy applying these formulas, we generate a Weighted Rating for each movie that reflects not only the average sentiment of its reviews but also how that sentiment weighs against the broader context of all movies in the report. This approach yields a more balanced and contextualized sentiment rating, distinguishing between movies with a strong consensus of opinion and those with more divided sentiment, regardless of whether that sentiment is positive or negative.\nDisplayed below is a comparative graph that delineates the top 10 movies with the highest positive sentiment ratings alongside the top 10 movies with the highest negative sentiment ratings.\n \n\n  \n  Figure-4: Bar graph showing the ratings of top 10 movies with highest positive sentiments\n\n\nThe graph presents a selection of the most critically acclaimed films, each of which boasts a remarkable rating exceeding 9.5 on Rotten Tomatoes. These ratings, derived from aggregated critic reviews, underscore a near-unanimous consensus on the exceptional quality of these films, marking them as standout choices for audiences seeking the finest in film entertainment.\n \n\n  \n  Figure-5: Bar graph showing the ratings of top 10 movies with highest negative sentiments\n\n\nThe graph above inversely illustrates the relationship between high negative ratings and the prevalence of negative reviews. In this context, a higher rating corresponds to a greater proportion of negative feedback. The chart specifically spotlights the movies that have received the lowest ratings on Rotten Tomatoes, showcasing those that have, unfortunately, not resonated well with critics and audiences alike.\nThrough a comprehensive sentiment analysis conducted on the entire dataset, we have been able to distill the films that polarize opinion to the most and least favorably received. This analysis provides insightful contrasts, highlighting not only the critically acclaimed successes but also those films that have elicited less favorable reactions, offering a holistic view of the cinematic landscape as reflected in Rotten Tomatoes’ extensive review compendium.\nThe graph below combines two pieces of information: which movies are most often recommended on Reddit, and what reviewers think of them. By bringing these two sets of data together, we can see not just which movies are popular to suggest, but also how well they are received based on their review scores. This way, we get a clearer picture of the most talked-about movies and whether the buzz around them is positive or not.\n\n\n\nFigure-6: Lollipop plot showing the review ratings for the top 10 suggested movies on reddit\n\n\nAnalysis: Our analysis reveals an intriguing aspect of movie recommendations and ratings. While some films are frequently suggested by people, their ratings do not always align with this high level of recommendation. For instance, ‘Hereditary’, ‘Alien’, and ‘Oldboy’ are often brought up in discussions and recommended, yet their ratings, although positive, aren’t exceptionally high. This discrepancy highlights a deeper layer of audience engagement.\nIt suggests that these movies have a unique appeal that resonates with viewers on a level beyond conventional ratings. Perhaps these films offer a distinctive storyline, groundbreaking cinematography, or memorable performances that deeply impact viewers, making them popular recommendations despite not having top-tier ratings. This phenomenon underscores the idea that the true value of a movie in the eyes of its audience can extend beyond numerical ratings and delve into more subjective, personal experiences. These films evidently have a special place in the hearts of their viewers, indicative of a more profound connection that transcends traditional rating metrics.\n\n\nANIME ANALYSIS\nAfter analyzing movie data and their reviews, we applied the same approach to Anime by examining discussions on Reddit and gathering review data from MyAnimeList. We used the same techniques, like identifying names using Named Entity Recognition (NER), and analyzing discussion patterns and context, to find out which Anime are most talked about on Reddit. This method can be used for any type of entertainment discussed on Reddit, as long as we can find external review data to compare it with.\nOnce we gathered the anime list, we focused on identifying the top 10 anime that are most frequently recommended on Reddit. This helped us pinpoint which anime series are particularly popular and highly recommended within the Reddit community.\n \n\n  \n  Figure-7: Radial bar chart representing top 10 suggested anime on Reddit\n\n\nThe graph displays a radial bar chart. Each radial bar corresponds to a specific anime title, and the length of the bar represents the frequency of suggestions on Reddit. The longest bar points towards “Shingeki no Kyojin,” indicating that this anime is the most suggested among the ones listed. Other notable titles include “Steins;Gate” and “Code Geass,” which also have long bars, showing that they are highly recommended within the Reddit community as well. The shortest bars, corresponding to titles like “Meido in Abisu” (likely “Made in Abyss”) and “Monsuta” (“Monster”), suggest that while these series are still among the top 10 suggested, they are recommended less frequently than the others.\nAfter gathering the external review data, we conducted a detailed analysis to uncover various insights about anime preferences. We categorized the highly rated anime based on their genres, pinpointing which types of anime received the best reviews. Additionally, we identified the most popular anime within each genre, giving us an understanding of which styles and stories resonate the most with audiences.\nWe didn’t stop there; we also looked at the overall ratings across all genres to determine which anime series stood out in terms of viewer ratings. By doing this, we created a picture of anime popularity and quality, segmented by genre and overall reception.\n \n\n  \n  Figure-8: Bar graph showing the ratings of top-rated anime titles across all genres.\n\n\nThe above graph visualizes the top-rated anime movies across various genres based on their scores. The bar graph shows a distribution of scores for each anime title, with the rating ranging from 9.00 to 9.23. The color scale, ranging from light to dark shades, emphasizes the rating, providing a visual representation of the rating intensity.\nTitles like “Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood,” “Hunter x Hunter 2011,” and “SteinsGate” stand out as the top-rated anime. These titles have achieved exceptionally high rating, indicating their widespread acclaim among viewers. The graph provides additional information upon hovering over the bars, including the title, rating, and associated genres. This interactive feature allows users to explore details for each anime. We further wanted to expand this analysis, by highlighting the frequency of specific genres within the top-rated titles.\n \n\n  \n  Figure-9: Plot showing the distribution of genre across top-rated anime titles.\n\n\nThe above graph visualizes the distribution of genres among the top-rated titles. Looking at the graph, it’s evident that certain genres are more prevalent among the top-rated anime, particularly Youth and School Life and Drama and Romance tend to be more prevalent among the top-rated anime titles,indicating a significant audience preference for stories revolving around school life and romantic dramas, possibly due to relatable themes or engaging narratives within these genres. The diversity of genres also demonstrates the varied tastes and interests of anime enthusiasts.\n \n\n  \n  Figure-10: Bar graph showing top 10 highly rated anime by genre\n\n\nThe above graph serves as an interactive tool to navigate through the most celebrated anime series, organized by genre, with a selection of 10 distinct genres.\nIt’s worth noting that some anime series have a multifaceted appeal, crossing over into multiple genres. Consequently, these versatile shows appear in several genre categories within the graph. This frequent occurrence among the top-tier anime suggests that the most acclaimed series often blend elements from different genres, enhancing their richness and broadening their appeal. The graph’s design likely accounts for this overlap, ensuring that each anime is represented in all the genres it’s associated with, providing a thorough and accurate representation of the anime landscape as per the genre classifications.\nTo see the most Popular Anime across each Genre we used popularity score in the dataset to get the anime list popular across different genres.\n \n\n  \n  Figure-11: Bar graph showing top 10 popular anime by genre\n\n\nThe data reveals an interesting distinction between the highest-rated anime and those that are most popular. Some shows that didn’t make it to the ‘top anime’ list based on ratings have found a spot on the ‘most popular’ list. This discrepancy highlights a key insight: an anime’s popularity doesn’t always correlate with its critical ratings.\nThese popular anime, sourced from MyAnimeList, resonate with a large audience, perhaps because of their engaging storylines, memorable characters, or cultural impact, despite not necessarily receiving the highest scores in reviews. This aspect of popularity, separate from critical acclaim, captures the essence of what viewers are actually watching and talking about.\nIn the next step of our analysis, we’ll compare this popularity data from MyAnimeList with the Reddit suggestions data. This comparison will further our understanding of viewer preferences and show how anime trends on Reddit align with the broader viewership statistics from MyAnimeList. Through this, we aim to uncover whether the anime that sparks the most conversation on Reddit are also the ones that are being watched the most according to MyAnimeList’s popularity metrics.\n\nMoving forward with our analysis, we aim to bridge the gap between recommendation frequency on Reddit and the critical reception of those recommended titles. To facilitate this, the subsequent graph has been crafted to showcase the review ratings of the anime that have been most frequently suggested on Reddit.\n\n\n\nFigure: Lollipop plot showing the review ratings for the top 10 suggested anime on reddit\n\n\nThe analysis of the anime series reveals a pattern similar to that observed with movies: being highly rated across various genres does not necessarily equate to being frequently suggested on Reddit. While a select few anime achieve high ratings and are still often recommended, it appears that this is not the norm for most.\nThis consistent observation underscores a unique aspect of community-driven platforms like Reddit. Certain anime series may not receive the highest accolades from critics or achieve top scores in every genre, yet they cultivate a dedicated following and generate significant buzz on Reddit. These shows may possess certain qualities—such as compelling storytelling, niche appeal, or a loyal fanbase—that endear them to viewers, making them popular in discussions even if they are not universally acclaimed.\nThis phenomenon highlights that some shows are underrated gems, whose value is recognized and celebrated within the Reddit community. Their popularity on such social platforms suggests that there are additional layers of appreciation and enjoyment that standard rating systems may not fully capture. These series resonate with the audience in a way that transcends conventional rankings, cementing their place in the cultural conversation on platforms like Reddit."

    "text": "Introduction\nReddit serves as a colossal online gathering where people, each with unique backgrounds, share stories, photos, and ideas within specialized communities known as subreddits. Users actively shape the platform by voting on content, creating a dynamic and human-driven experience that mirrors the diversity of our online world.\nVenturing into Reddit’s expansive digital realm, our exploration takes us deep into the heart of entertainment discussions. Our focal point is the dedicated subreddit for all things entertainment, where users converge to share, analyze, and celebrate the multifaceted cultural and media landscape. Tasked with revealing the hidden gems within, we utilize a curated subset of the Reddit Archive dataset, encapsulating the spirit of discussions from January to March 2023.\nWithin the entertainment subreddit, we don’t merely observe trends; instead, we’re immersed in a vibrant tapestry of discussions.

This focused approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of the entertainment discussions taking place within these distinct corners of the Reddit platform.\n\n\nData Overview\nDiving into a whopping 412 GB of posts and 918 GB of comments, the dataset is like a big storybook with 109 million entries. It’s carefully organized by simplifying things—removing some details, changing time info to something we can understand, and putting it in a format that’s easy to explore, like preparing a canvas before painting. Now, it’s all set up and ready for us to start looking through and discovering what’s inside.\nExternal dataset: The project utilizes datasets from Kaggle’s “Clapper: Massive Rotten Tomatoes Movies and Reviews” and “MyAnimeList” collections. These datasets offer a rich source of information for analyzing trends, preferences, and sentiments in the domain of movies and anime. This approach aims to delve into the intricacies of viewer engagement and sentiment patterns across diverse content genres, providing a comprehensive understanding of audience behavior in the entertainment industry.\nThe Rotten Tomatoes dataset offers a detailed compilation of movie reviews and ratings, while the MyAnimeList dataset provides insights into anime popularity and viewer preferences. Together, these datasets form a robust foundation for cross-platform analysis.\nData Source 1 Data Source 2\n\n\nObjective\nOur mission is clear: to decipher the language of entertainment discussions on Reddit, extracting findings that resonate with both seasoned enthusiasts and those new to the subject matter. We will focus on the first two objectives — revealing what the data says and interpreting its significance by providing answers to the following questions.\n\nBusiness Goal: Optimize content strategy by understanding peak engagement times. Knowing when users are most active can guide when to post for maximum visibility and interaction.\nTechnical Proposal: Using EDA, we will conduct a time series analysis on the hour_of_day and day_of_week_str data for each subreddit. By aggregating post frequencies based on these time variables, we can visualize trends and identify peak activity periods. This analysis will provide insights into the most favorable times to post content on each subreddit, helping optimize the content strategy for enhanced user interaction and visibility.\nBusiness Goal: Identifying key contributors to help recognize influential users and understand their content preferences. This insight is valuable for community management and targeted marketing strategies.\nTechnical Proposal: Using EDA, analyze author data to quantify post frequency and engagement (likes, comments). Apply statistical measures to highlight top contributors and content analysis to understand the themes and types of their posts.\nBusiness Goal: This seeks to understand how the content influences user engagement, guiding content creators on the most engaging content.\nTechnical Proposal: Using EDA, we will compare the average score and number of comments between posts with different content using statistical methods.\nBusiness Goal: To Understand popular themes that can guide content creation and marketing strategies, ensuring alignment with audience interests.\nTechnical Proposal: Applying NLP techniques like topic modeling or keyword extraction to the titles and selftext of high-engagement posts. This analysis will identify prevalent themes and topics in popular content.\nBusiness Goal: Gauging the overall sentiment of posts in each subreddit to inform tone and messaging strategies for engaging with these communities effectively.\nTechnical Proposal: Performing sentiment analysis on the title and selftext of posts. This involves using NLP tools to classify content into sentiment categories (positive, negative, neutral) and comparing these across subreddits.\nBusiness Goal: Identifying unique lexicon can aid in creating more relatable and targeted content for each subreddit community.\nTechnical Proposal:Use TF-IDF analysis to distinguish words and phrases that are uniquely prevalent in each subreddit. This helps in understanding the distinctive language style of each community.\nBusiness Goal: Understanding how sentiment affects engagement can help in tailoring content for better reception and interaction.\nTechnical Proposal: Combine sentiment analysis results with engagement metrics (score, comments) to explore correlations. This involves statistical analysis to determine if there’s a significant relationship between sentiment and user engagement.\nBusiness Goal: This prediction model can guide content creators in optimizing their posts for higher engagement, leading to increased visibility and interaction.\nTechnical Proposal: Developing a predictive model using features like post length, presence of media, time of posting, and NLP-derived text features. Machine learning techniques like regression or classification can be employed to forecast engagement levels.\nBusiness Goal: Predicting posting time based on content can assist in understanding user behavior patterns and content preferences at different times.\nTechnical Proposal: Creating a model to predict the likely time of posting using features extracted from post content and style. This involves applying classification algorithms to correlate content features with posting times.\nBusiness Goal: Efficiently categorizing posts can aid in content moderation and ensure appropriate audience targeting.\nTechnical Proposal: Use text data and other relevant features to train a classification model that can distinguish between adult-oriented and general audience content.

    "text": "Hello and welcome!\nLorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry’s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.\nContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of “de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum” (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..”, comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from “de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum” by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham."
