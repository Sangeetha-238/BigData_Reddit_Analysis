    "text": "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) plays a pivotal role in our project focused on unraveling the dynamics of the Entertainment subreddit within the vast landscape of Reddit. Think of this page as a magnifying glass, focusing on the intricacies of the colossal dataset. Each entry is a chapter in the evolving story, carefully organized for exploration, much like preparing a canvas before an artist begins to paint.\nJoin us on this analytical odyssey where every data point is a clue, and every visualization is a window into the nuanced landscape of the Entertainment subreddit. The EDA page is where we decode the language of data, bringing you closer to the stories that lie beneath the surface of this dynamic digital community. Welcome to the realm of Exploratory Data Analysis, where understanding the data is the key to unlocking the richness of our Reddit exploration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of missing values in the data\nThis table represents a summary of missing values in a dataset extracted from Reddit. Each row corresponds to a different feature in the dataset, and the ‘Missing Values’ column quantifies the absence of data entries for each feature.\nColumns such as ‘author’, ‘title’, ‘selftext’, ‘created_utc’, ‘num_comments’, ‘score’, ‘over_18’, ‘pinned’, and ‘locked’ show complete data with zero missing values, suggesting they are mandatory fields within the platform’s post submission process.\nIn contrast, a significant number of missing values are observed in the ‘disable_comments’, ‘distinguished’, and ‘media’ columns. This could indicate that these fields are not always applicable or are frequently left blank. For instance, ‘distinguished’ could denote a special status assigned to certain posts, which would naturally be less common. Similarly, ‘media’ might be optional or applicable only for certain types of posts.\nThis table is important for understanding the dataset’s structure and quality, and it underlines the need for thorough data cleaning and validation steps before any reliable analysis can be performed.\n\n \n\n  \n  Table-1: Count of missing values of all the columns for submissions dataset\n\n\n\n\nAnalysing the extracted submissions in subreddits\nThis bar chart provides a comparative analysis of post counts across various entertainment-related subreddits. The ‘anime’ subreddit has the highest number of posts, with over 400,000 entries, indicative of a very active community with a strong interest in anime-related content. This is followed by the ‘movies’ subreddit, which also boasts a high level of activity with more than 380,000 posts. Both ‘anime’ and ‘movies’ subreddits significantly outpace the ‘television’ subreddit in terms of post counts, suggesting a comparatively higher user engagement in the former topics.\nLooking at subreddits dedicated to suggestions within these categories (AnimeSuggestions, MovieSuggestions, and televisionsuggestions), there is a clear indication that there is a substantial interest in community-driven recommendations for anime, as the ‘AnimeSuggestions’ subreddit has a higher post count than both ‘MovieSuggestions’ and ‘televisionsuggestions’. The ‘MovieSuggestions’ subreddit has a moderate number of posts, while ‘televisionsuggestions’ has the least, reflecting lower user engagement for television recommendations on this platform.\nThese differences in post counts may reflect varying degrees of popularity, user engagement, and possibly the availability of content in each entertainment medium. The data suggests that within this online community, users are more likely to seek and share recommendations for anime and movies rather than television shows.\n\n\n\nFigure-1: Count of each subreddit in the dataset from 2021-2023\n\n\n\n\nTime-series Analysis\n\nWhat is the general trend of posts from 2021-2023?\nThe time-related plots depicting the distribution of posts across the subreddits ‘anime’, ‘movies’, and ‘television’ from 2021 to 2023 reveal a discernible downward trajectory in user engagement and post counts. While the ‘anime’ subreddit shows a pronounced peak, indicative of a temporary surge in activity, it is followed by a significant decline. This pattern suggests that sustaining high engagement levels over time may be challenging, even when punctuated by periods of heightened activity.\nIn parallel, the ‘movies’ and ‘television’ subreddits exhibit a more gradual decline, implying a slow yet consistent decrease in the number of posts and interactions. This could point to a broader trend of diminishing user participation or could reflect a diversification of discussions across newer platforms or different online communities.\nThe overarching decline across all three subreddits raises questions about the factors influencing these changes. The possibility of shifting platform dynamics, evolving content consumption patterns, or the rise of alternative entertainment forums could be contributing to this trend. It indicates a potential shift in the digital landscape where traditional subreddit forums may no longer command the same level of attention as before.\nThis insight suggests an opportunity for subreddit administrators and content creators to re-evaluate their engagement strategies. Exploring innovative content delivery, leveraging interactive media, or tapping into emerging trends could potentially reverse the decline in post counts. As digital platforms continue to evolve, so must the strategies to captivate and maintain active user communities.\n \n\n  \n  Figure-2: This graph illustrates the normalized post count trends across three subreddits (anime, movies, and television) over a span of two years, from January 2021 to April 2023. The peaks and troughs indicate fluctuations in user engagement and post frequency within these online communities.\n\n\n\n\nHow are scores affected by posting on different days of the month?\nThe line chart titled “Average Score by Day of Month Across Subreddits” offers a detailed visual of how user engagement varies throughout the month within the subreddits of ‘movies’, ‘anime’, and ‘television’. The ‘movies’ subreddit demonstrates the highest variance in average scores, suggesting that certain days of the month may align with the release of popular content, leading to spikes in user interaction and high-scoring posts. In contrast, ‘anime’ and ‘television’ subreddits exhibit a more consistent pattern of engagement, with less pronounced peaks and troughs.\nThe trend across all three subreddits does not show a clear cyclical pattern that could be associated with specific days of the month, indicating that post scores are more likely influenced by content availability and user interest rather than the time of the month. The relative stability in ‘anime’ and ‘television’ subreddits could imply a steady production of content that resonates with the audience, leading to a more uniform level of engagement.\nThis insight into user behavior could be harnessed by content creators and marketers to strategically time their posts to coincide with peak engagement periods identified within the ‘movies’ subreddit. Moreover, the consistent engagement in the ‘anime’ and ‘television’ subreddits suggests a reliable and dedicated audience base, which could be attractive to advertisers and collaborators looking for stable platforms to promote their products or services. Overall, understanding these engagement patterns is crucial for optimizing content delivery and maintaining a vibrant and interactive online community.\n \n\n  \n  Figure-3:Average score of posts submitted on different days of the month from 2021-2023\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis of the number of posts during the week\nThe sunburst chart provides a vivid depiction of the distribution of posts across days of the week and hours of the day for the subreddits ‘anime’, ‘movies’, and ‘television’. It reveals the time-specific activity patterns within these communities. For the ‘anime’ subreddit, there’s a notable concentration of activity during certain hours, which may correspond to peak times when users are most active or when new content is typically released. The ‘movies’ subreddit shows a more spread out activity throughout the week, suggesting a consistent level of engagement without significant peaks or troughs.\nThis visual suggests that the ‘television’ subreddit has its own unique pattern of user interaction, potentially reflecting the airing schedule of popular shows or weekly events that drive discussions. Understanding these patterns can help content creators and moderators to optimize their engagement strategies by scheduling posts and discussions during high-activity windows to maximize visibility and interaction.\nOverall, these insights highlight the importance of timing in online community engagement. For marketers and content creators, aligning content releases with these observed peaks could enhance user engagement. For platform moderators, it could inform the scheduling of events or AMAs (Ask Me Anything sessions) to ensure higher participation rates. Additionally, this data could assist in the strategic placement of advertisements, ensuring they reach the most active audience segments.\n \n\n  \n  Figure-4: Number of posts during the week for the subreddits\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Engagement Analysis\n\nComparative Analysis of Post Engagement by Length and Score in Entertainment-Related Subreddits\nThis scatter plot illustrates the engagement dynamics of Reddit posts, comparing post length to user engagement across subreddits dedicated to anime, movies, and television. Each dot represents an individual post, with its size corresponding to the score, which is a proxy for the post’s popularity or engagement level.\nA cursory analysis reveals a dense clustering of posts with scores under 10,000 across all subreddits, with post lengths predominantly falling below 2000 characters. This suggests that shorter posts are more common, regardless of the subreddit category. Interestingly, there is a visible trend where posts with higher scores tend to have shorter lengths, indicating that more concise posts may resonate better with the audience or are more likely to be engaged with.\nThe larger-sized dots, indicating posts with exceptionally high scores, are predominantly short and are scattered across all three subreddits. This may indicate that highly engaging posts, which are likely to go viral or hit the front page of Reddit, tend to be succinct.\nThis insight can inform content creators and marketers about optimal post lengths for audience engagement in different entertainment categories on Reddit.\n \n\n  \n  Figure-5: Correlation between post lengths and scores within anime, movies, and television subreddits on Reddit.\n\n\n\n\nTop Reddit Authors by Comment Engagement in the subreddit Discussion\nThe table presents a ranking of authors by the comment volume on their posts in the movie, television and anime subreddits. High comment counts generally indicate that an author’s contributions are well-received, sparking active discussions among the subreddit’s users. This level of engagement typically reflects the community’s interest and the value they find in the content shared by the author.\nThe table not only identifies the most engaging authors in the subreddits but also underscores the importance of creating content that encourages community participation. The data provides valuable insights into user engagement and could be leveraged to understand better what types of posts cultivate active discussions in online communities.\n\n \n\n  \n  Table-2: Ranks of authors from a subreddit based on the number of comments their posts receive, highlighting the most engaging content creators\n\n\n\n\nLeading Content Creators based on top Comments\nThe bar chart presents the post counts attributed to the ten most active authors within the subreddits “movies, anime, and television”. These counts are a direct indicator of the quantity of content contributed by individual authors rather than the quality or engagement level of the posts.\nThe presence of active contributors can be vital for fostering community engagement and providing a steady stream of content for discussion. On the other hand, the steep drop in post counts after the third author indicates that there is less parity in content contribution among the top authors. The remaining seven authors in the list show a relatively lower level of activity, with post counts ranging from moderate to minimal. This disparity suggests that a small group of authors may dominate the conversation or content within this subreddit.\nThe movies subreddit appears to have a few highly active authors who contribute a significant portion of the content. This concentration of activity might influence the diversity of topics and perspectives presented within the community.\nIn the television subreddit, the distribution of post counts among the top ten authors reveals a significant skew, with ‘MarvelsGrantMan136’ and ‘Neo2199’ being the most active. This pattern suggests that the television subreddit may rely on a small group of dedicated individuals for a substantial portion of its content, which could potentially influence the scope and variety of discussions within the community.\nContrastingly, the anime subreddit presents a unique scenario where bots, rather than human authors, are the primary content contributors. Interestingly, despite—or perhaps because of—the automated nature of their posts, these bot-generated discussions are engaging the community to a greater extent than typical human-authored posts on the platform. This could be attributed to the bots providing timely, consistently formatted, and relevant content that resonates well with the subreddit’s audience.\nThe high engagement with bot posts in the anime subreddit may also reflect the community’s preference for structured information, such as regular updates on anime releases, episode discussions, and well-organized recommendation lists. These automated posts may fulfill the community’s needs more effectively than the more varied human contributions found in other subreddits.\nIn light of this, the anime subreddit stands out as a unique case study in community engagement on social platforms, showcasing that automated systems, when well-tuned to the audience’s preferences, can play a pivotal role in fostering active online communities. This insight challenges the conventional wisdom that the most engaging content must be human-generated and highlights the potential for bots to contribute meaningfully to online discourse in interest-specific forums.\n \n\n  \n  Figure-6: This bar chart ranks the top 10 authors in the subreddit based on the number of posts they have made and the top comments received\n\n\n\n\nTop Reddit Posts Authors by Scores Engagement in the subreddit Discussion\nThe table shows a list from a subreddit, ranking the top 10 posts by score. For the movie subreddit, the highest-scoring post is an AMA with Tobey Maguire, indicating that interactive sessions with famous actors are highly valued in the community. This is further emphasized by the presence of another AMA with Keanu Reeves in the second position. The third highest post by Nicolas Cage suggests that personal engagement from actors or filmmakers garners significant attention.\nPosts regarding industry news and opinions, such as the win of Brendan Fraser at the Academy Awards and a call to prioritize voice actors over celebrities in animated features, reflect the community’s interest in both celebrating achievements and critiquing industry trends. A post about a ‘Dune’ sequel hints at the community’s enthusiasm for science fiction and blockbuster franchises.\nNotably, there is a discussion on diversity in casting, pointing towards a conscious reflection on representation in movies. The list also shows a mix of content authors, from individual users to likely official accounts like “lionsgate,” indicating a blend of community-driven content and industry participation in the subreddit.\nFor the television subreddit, The most popular post highlights a public figure, LeVar Burton, expressing his desire to become the new host of “Jeopardy!”, which is indicative of the community’s interest in show hostings and personalities associated with them. This is further emphasized by another post where Burton encourages the producers of “Jeopardy!” to consider him for the role, showcasing the community’s support for his candidacy.\nOther posts indicate strong community interest in television show news and updates, like the revival of “Futurama” and a potential third season for “Mindhunter.” The active engagement in these topics suggests that news about television series renewals and continuations is particularly resonant with the audience.\nThese posts reflect a community that is deeply engaged with the television industry, from show developments and castings to the achievements and remembrances of beloved television figures. The scores provide insight into what type of content the community values and discusses most, which includes industry news, show developments, and the accomplishments and milestones of individuals in television.\nMoving to the anime, The top post is about the death of Kentaro Miura, the creator of “Berserk,” which underscores the impact that influential figures in the anime industry have on the community. The high score indicates that news about significant personalities, especially those who have made a profound impact on the genre, resonates deeply with the audience.\nSeveral posts relate to announcements of new seasons for popular anime series like “The Devil is a Part-Timer,” “Spice and Wolf,” and “Konosuba.” This suggests that the subreddit is a hub for fans to discuss and share their excitement about continuing series and new developments within their favorite anime.\nThere is also a post about a prediction tournament for “Best Girl,” a common discussion topic in anime communities where fans vote for their favorite female characters. The popularity of such a post indicates that interactive and participatory events are engaging for the community members.\n\n \n\n  \n  Table-3: Ranks of authors from a subreddit based on the Scores their posts receive, highlighting the most engaging content creators\n\n\n\n\nLeading Content Creators based on top Scores\nThe bar chart depicts the top 10 authors by post count within the anime, movies, and television subreddits, with a specific focus on those receiving the highest scores, which could be indicative of the popularity of the posts.\n‘AutoLovepon’ leads in the anime subreddit with an exceptionally high post count, indicating a significant impact on the community, likely due to consistent, high-quality content, which could be automated. In the movies subreddit, ‘MarvelsGrantMan136’ dominates but is followed by a group of authors with notable contributions, reflecting a community with diverse yet influential voices. The television subreddit shows ‘MarvelsGrantMan136’ leading, with a narrower margin over ‘chanma50’, suggesting a broader spread of engagement across various authors. These patterns highlight different engagement dynamics, with a single dominant presence in anime and a more varied influence among authors in the movies and television subreddits, offering insights into community preferences and influencer identification.\n \n\n  \n  Figure-7: This bar chart ranks the top 10 authors in the subreddit based on the number of posts they have made and the top scores received\n\n\n\n\nAuthors with the highest number of posts\nThe bar chart provides an overview of the top 10 active authors in the anime, movies, and television subreddits, showing a clear disparity in activity levels across these categories.\nFor the movies subreddit, the top author has an exceptionally high post count, exceeding 20,000, which is significantly higher than the subsequent authors. This could imply a central role in the subreddit, possibly as a source of extensive information or regular discussion threads. However, the drop in post counts among the following authors is stark, indicating a less concentrated field of active contributors and suggesting a more varied source of content within the community.\nIn the television subreddit, the post counts among the top authors are more evenly distributed, with ‘MarvelsGrantMan136’ leading but with a smaller margin compared to the leaders in the anime and movies subreddits. This indicates a more balanced contribution from the top authors, which could result in a diverse range of discussions and viewpoints being represented in the subreddit.\nMoving to the anime subreddit, the leading author, presumably a bot named ‘AutoLovepon’, has a post count that far exceeds that of any human contributor, with over 6000 posts. This suggests a high level of automation in content generation, which is indicative of a structured and consistent posting strategy, possibly catering to the demand for updates, recommendations, or scheduled discussion threads. Given the nature of bot-generated content, this level of activity might provide a streamlined experience for users seeking information without the variability of human-authored posts.\nIn conclusion, these engagement models reflect the unique cultural dynamics of each subreddit, providing valuable insights for content creators, moderators, and marketers on how to approach each community effectively.\n \n\n  \n  Figure-8: This bar chart ranks the top 10 authors in the subreddit based on the number of posts they have made\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion for Engagement Analysis:\nThe comparative analysis of the post counts from the top authors across the anime, movies, and television subreddits reveals distinct patterns of community engagement and content contribution. In the anime subreddit, the dominance of the bot ‘AutoLovepon’ highlights a preference for structured, automated content, which contrasts sharply with the human-driven contributions in the movies and television subreddits. In movies, a few authors, particularly ‘MarvelsGrantMan136’, contribute a majority of the content, suggesting a central role in driving discussions and shaping the subreddit’s narrative. Conversely, the television subreddit demonstrates a more balanced distribution of post counts among the top authors, indicating a diverse range of discussions and viewpoints. These patterns underscore the varying dynamics of online communities and the different roles that authors, whether human or automated, play in shaping the content and discussions within these digital spaces. This analysis not only provides insights into the unique characteristics of each subreddit but also underscores the importance of understanding audience preferences and engagement styles when creating or moderating content in online communities."

    "title": "Analysis on Entertainment Reddits",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nReddit serves as a colossal online gathering where people, each with unique backgrounds, share stories, photos, and ideas within specialized communities known as subreddits. Users actively shape the platform by voting on content, creating a dynamic and human-driven experience that mirrors the diversity of our online world.\nVenturing into Reddit’s expansive digital realm, our exploration takes us deep into the heart of entertainment discussions. Our focal point is the dedicated subreddit for all things entertainment, where users converge to share, analyze, and celebrate the multifaceted cultural and media landscape. Tasked with revealing the hidden gems within, we utilize a curated subset of the Reddit Archive dataset, encapsulating the spirit of discussions from January to March 2023.\nWithin the entertainment subreddit, we don’t merely observe trends; instead, we’re immersed in a vibrant tapestry of discussions. Our analysis aims to uncover the rhythms—echoing trends in popular media and subtle nuances defining user sentiments through a fusion of data science techniques, vivid visualizations, natural language processing and machine learning.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the purpose of this project, the analysis is performed on the subreddits : r/anime, r/television, r/televisionsuggestions, r/movies, r/Animesuggest, r/MovieSuggestions.\n\nr/anime: This subreddit is dedicated to anime-related discussions, encompassing a wide range of topics, including reviews, recommendations, and general discourse about the anime medium.\nr/television: This subreddit caters to discussions about television shows, spanning various genres and formats. Users engage in conversations about current and past TV series, share recommendations, and discuss industry news.\nr/televisionsuggestions: As a subreddit dedicated explicitly to TV show recommendations, this community serves as a hub for users seeking and providing suggestions for what to watch next.\nr/movies: This subreddit covers a wide range of topics related to films, including discussions about specific movies, industry news, and analyses of cinematic techniques.\nr/Animesuggest: Similar to r/televisionsuggestions but for anime, this subreddit is dedicated to helping users discover new anime titles based on their preferences.\nr/MovieSuggestions: Serving as a space specifically for movie recommendations, this subreddit is an ideal place for users seeking personalized suggestions for their next film to watch.\n\nBy targeting these specific subreddits, the analysis aims to uncover patterns, trends, and user sentiments unique to each community. This focused approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of the entertainment discussions taking place within these distinct corners of the Reddit platform.\n\n\nData Overview\nDiving into a whopping 412 GB of posts and 918 GB of comments, the dataset is like a big storybook with 109 million entries. It’s carefully organized by simplifying things—removing some details, changing time info to something we can understand, and putting it in a format that’s easy to explore, like preparing a canvas before painting. Now, it’s all set up and ready for us to start looking through and discovering what’s inside.\nExternal dataset: For a comprehensive analysis, data from Netflix’s top movies and shows will be incorporated to draw insightful comparisons with the Reddit analysis. This multi-dimensional approach aims to explore the viewing preferences, engagement patterns, and sentiment dynamics across both platforms, providing a nuanced understanding of user behavior in the realms of online streaming and social media interaction.\nThe data provides a curated list of the highest-rated movies and TV shows on Netflix for each year, ensuring a minimum threshold of votes and emphasizing IMDb score as a key metric for ranking.\nData Source\n\n\nObjective\nOur mission is clear: to decipher the language of entertainment discussions on Reddit, extracting findings that resonate with both seasoned enthusiasts and those new to the subject matter. We will focus on the first two objectives — revealing what the data says and interpreting its significance by providing answers to the following questions.\n\nBusiness Goal: Optimize content strategy by understanding peak engagement times. Knowing when users are most active can guide when to post for maximum visibility and interaction.\nTechnical Proposal: Using EDA, we will conduct a time series analysis on the hour_of_day and day_of_week_str data for each subreddit. By aggregating post frequencies based on these time variables, we can visualize trends and identify peak activity periods. This analysis will provide insights into the most favorable times to post content on each subreddit, helping optimize the content strategy for enhanced user interaction and visibility.\nBusiness Goal: Identifying key contributors to help recognize influential users and understand their content preferences. This insight is valuable for community management and targeted marketing strategies.\nTechnical Proposal: Using EDA, analyze author data to quantify post frequency and engagement (likes, comments). Apply statistical measures to highlight top contributors and content analysis to understand the themes and types of their posts.\nBusiness Goal: This seeks to understand how the content influences user engagement, guiding content creators on the most engaging content.\nTechnical Proposal: Using EDA, we will compare the average score and number of comments between posts with different content using statistical methods.\nBusiness Goal: To Understand popular themes that can guide content creation and marketing strategies, ensuring alignment with audience interests.\nTechnical Proposal: Applying NLP techniques like topic modeling or keyword extraction to the titles and selftext of high-engagement posts. This analysis will identify prevalent themes and topics in popular content.\nBusiness Goal: Gauging the overall sentiment of posts in each subreddit to inform tone and messaging strategies for engaging with these communities effectively.\nTechnical Proposal: Performing sentiment analysis on the title and selftext of posts. This involves using NLP tools to classify content into sentiment categories (positive, negative, neutral) and comparing these across subreddits.\nBusiness Goal: Identifying unique lexicon can aid in creating more relatable and targeted content for each subreddit community.\nTechnical Proposal:Use TF-IDF analysis to distinguish words and phrases that are uniquely prevalent in each subreddit. This helps in understanding the distinctive language style of each community.\nBusiness Goal: Understanding how sentiment affects engagement can help in tailoring content for better reception and interaction.\nTechnical Proposal: Combine sentiment analysis results with engagement metrics (score, comments) to explore correlations. This involves statistical analysis to determine if there’s a significant relationship between sentiment and user engagement.\nBusiness Goal: This prediction model can guide content creators in optimizing their posts for higher engagement, leading to increased visibility and interaction.\nTechnical Proposal: Developing a predictive model using features like post length, presence of media, time of posting, and NLP-derived text features. Machine learning techniques like regression or classification can be employed to forecast engagement levels.\nBusiness Goal: Predicting posting time based on content can assist in understanding user behavior patterns and content preferences at different times.\nTechnical Proposal: Creating a model to predict the likely time of posting using features extracted from post content and style. This involves applying classification algorithms to correlate content features with posting times.\nBusiness Goal: Efficiently categorizing posts can aid in content moderation and ensure appropriate audience targeting.\nTechnical Proposal: Use text data and other relevant features to train a classification model that can distinguish between adult-oriented and general audience content. This involves using NLP techniques for feature extraction and applying classifiers like SVM or logistic regression."

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry’s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.\nContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of “de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum” (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..”, comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from “de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum” by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham."
