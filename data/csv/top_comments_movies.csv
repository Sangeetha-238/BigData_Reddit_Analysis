I know it'll probably get some who don't agree.

But everyone I know loves it, it's even a Christmas tradition for some families around here. Which is bizarre on how popular it's remained, and I'm not saying I'm anti Grease to the point of causing a divide, I just don't get the fuss about it.

14,movies,What movie has the perfect soundtrack?,17458,"Many franchises are considered to have the most remarkable soundtracks(hp,lotr,sw...) but at the same time the composers of the songs that follow the story have all an unique style for creating the themes that are part of the film.

The composer that is considered as the father of all movie songs(at least for most people) is john willians. Probably because he was the one who revolutionized the cinema history by founding the genre 'space opera' together with George Lucas. However, there are musicians who made exceptional jobs like howard shore or hans zimmer(this one is probably the closest to the geniality of willians) that for some people are more remarkable than willians.

For me, something that really has a big weight on forming this kind of opinion is the nostalgia relationed to the movie at the time the person watched it(like childhood or teenage years).

(I'm gonna get judged of my movie taste based of like 4 hot takes whoops, but whatever here it is)

I'd say 

The Matrix Sequels: definitely not as great as the first film but still decent imo. Reloaded is very good the chase scene on Highway is awesome the confusion exposition near the end is super easy to understand on a rewatch, Revolutions is not as good but still wouldn't call it bad. 

Cars 2: It's not boring has a cool detective plot, I liked it. I don't get the hate this film gets. The worst Pixar film is probably Brave Or Good Dinosaur not this.

Hottest take coming

Fantastic Beasts The Crimes of Grindelwald: Film isn't that bad, It's a mess but a beautiful mess hopefully with a co writer JK wrote a better screenplay for the next film, I'd say it's a 7.5/10. I actually liked it more than the first one, it's just better on rewatch, plot was wierd but you can't say the Grindelwald rally wasn't amazing and beautiful

Spider man 3- It's not even close to being as good as Spiderman 2 but it's still fun and not boring at all. I liked multiple villians",SirAren,15115
