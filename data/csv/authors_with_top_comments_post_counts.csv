We BOTH agree that we can't think of a single movie where the remake was better than the original. This conversation stemmed into a discussion about sequels vs original movies. This too we cannot think of a single sequel that we enjoyed more than an original film. There HAS to be ONE! help us 🤣,dpemerson76,18611,4

14,movies,What movie has the perfect soundtrack?,17458,"Many franchises are considered to have the most remarkable soundtracks(hp,lotr,sw...) but at the same time the composers of the songs that follow the story have all an unique style for creating the themes that are part of the film.

The composer that is considered as the father of all movie songs(at least for most people) is john willians. Probably because he was the one who revolutionized the cinema history by founding the genre 'space opera' together with George Lucas. However, there are musicians who made exceptional jobs like howard shore or hans zimmer(this one is probably the closest to the geniality of willians) that for some people are more remarkable than willians.

For me, something that really has a big weight on forming this kind of opinion is the nostalgia relationed to the movie at the time the person watched it(like childhood or teenage years).

(I'm gonna get judged of my movie taste based of like 4 hot takes whoops, but whatever here it is)

I'd say 

The Matrix Sequels: definitely not as great as the first film but still decent imo. Reloaded is very good the chase scene on Highway is awesome the confusion exposition near the end is super easy to understand on a rewatch, Revolutions is not as good but still wouldn't call it bad. 

Cars 2: It's not boring has a cool detective plot, I liked it. I don't get the hate this film gets. The worst Pixar film is probably Brave Or Good Dinosaur not this.

Hottest take coming

Fantastic Beasts The Crimes of Grindelwald: Film isn't that bad, It's a mess but a beautiful mess hopefully with a co writer JK wrote a better screenplay for the next film, I'd say it's a 7.5/10. I actually liked it more than the first one, it's just better on rewatch, plot was wierd but you can't say the Grindelwald rally wasn't amazing and beautiful

Spider man 3- It's not even close to being as good as Spiderman 2 but it's still fun and not boring at all. I liked multiple villians",SirAren,15115,13

51,television,Meghan Markle and Prince Harry interview with Oprah,4923,"The interview that aired last night on CBS revealed a lot of new information and clarified old information about how the royal family treated Meghan Markle ever since she started dating Harry. 

The bullet points: 

- When Meghan spent time with the Queen, she felt welcomed. She told a nice anecdote about the Queen sharing the blanket on her lap during a chilly car ride.

- Meghan never made Kate cry about a disagreement over flower girl dresses for the wedding. Kate made Meghan cry, but it was a stressful time, Kate apologized, and it was a non-issue. Yet 7 months later, the story was leaked with Meghan as the villain.

- The press played up a rivalry between Meghan and Kate. When Kate ate avocados, she got positive articles written about her and her food choices. When Meghan ate avocados, she was contributing to the death of the planet. When Kate touched her pregnant belly, it was sweet. When Meghan touched her pregnant belly, it was attention-seeking, vile behavior. That's two examples of many. 

- On several occasions, a member or more than one member of the royal family made comments about the skin tone of the children Harry would have with Meghan. Harry wouldn't say more, but it clearly hurt him and created a rift.

- Though Meghan was prepared to work for the royal family in the same capacity that other family members do, she was given no training for the role. She did her own research to the best of her ability with no guidance besides Harry's advice.

- The family / the firm told her she would be protected from the press to the extent they could manage, but that was a lie from the start. She was savaged in the press and it often took a racist bent. The family never stood up for her in the press or corrected lies.

- There is a symbiotic relationship between the royal family and the tabloids. A holiday party is hosted annually by the palace for the tabloids. There is an expectation to wine and dine tabloid staff and give full access in exchange for sympathetic treatment in the news stories.

- The family / the firm wasn't crazy about how well Meghan did on the Australia tour, which echoes memories of Diana doing surprisingly well on her first Australia tour and winning over the public. I'm not clear on how this manifested itself. Meghan said she thought the family would embrace her as an asset because she provided representation for many of the people of color who live in commonwealths, but this wasn't the case.

- Meghan's friends and family would tell her what the tabloids were saying about her and it became very stressful to deal with. She realized the firm wasn't protecting her at all. She says her only regret is believing they would provide the protection they promised. 

- Archie was not given a title and without the title, was not entitled to security. Meghan said a policy changed while she was pregnant with Archie that took this protection away from him, but the details of this are unclear to me. Other comments I've read make this muddy.

- Harry and Meghan didn't choose to not give Archie a title, but the family had it reported in the press that it was their choice. 

- When Meghan was feeling the most isolated and abandoned, she started having suicidal thoughts which really scared her because she had never felt that way before. She asked for help in the appropriate places and received none. Harry asked for help too and got nothing. She wanted to check herself into a facility to recover, but that was not an option without the palace arranging it, which they refused to do. 

- Once Meghan married into the family, she did not have her passport or ID or car keys anymore. This doesn't mean she couldn't have them if she needed them, but it seems like she would have needed a good, pre-approved reason to have them.

- Even when she wasn't leaving the house, the press was reporting on her as if she was an attention whore galavanting around town and starting problems.

- Finally Harry made the decision to take a step back. He wanted to become a part-time level working family member. They wanted to move to a commonwealth -- New Zealand, South Africa, Canada -- and settled on Canada. They expected to keep working for the family on a part time basis.

- Stories were published misrepresenting their departure. The Queen was not blindsided; she was notified in writing ahead of time of their plan. The idea of working part time was taken off the table. Their security was removed entirely.

- Scared of being unprotected amid numerous death threats (fueled immensely by the racist press), they moved to one of Tyler Perry's houses and he gave them security. Later they moved to their own home and presumably fund their own security now. 

- Harry felt trapped in the life he was born into. He feels compassion for his brother and father who are still ""trapped"" in the system.

Did I miss anything? Probably. 

At the beginning, they confirmed that no question was off the table. I'm disappointed Oprah didn't ask more questions. There was a lot more to cover. She didn't ask about Prince Andrew. She didn't touch on the birth certificate thing. She didn't try very hard to get the names of anyone who mistreated Meghan. 

I wish it wasn't all so vague. They didn't explain well enough the difference between the royal family and the firm or who was making the decisions. 

I also wish Oprah's reactions weren't so over-the-top phony. It's not all that surprising that some members of the royal family are racist or that they didn't fully embrace Meghan due to racism.

Oprah said there was more footage that hasn't been released yet, so I look forward to that, but I don't think it will contain any bombshells.",Comprehensive-Fun47,12611,25
